# Assignment: Your Own @WebRoute Annotation

## Task

Your task is to create a mini-webserver that uses reflection and annotations to route browser requests to specific handler methods.

You might have already seen something similar if you've used Flask's routing mechanism, e.g. `@app.route('/hello')` or if you've written Java Servlet-based webapps, e.g. `@WebServlet("/hello")`.

You will see later on that Spring does something similar with its `@RestController` and `@GetMapping` annotations.

### Details

Use the built-in webserver available from Java 8 and in later version.

* See the [documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/package-summary.html#package.description) of its features.
* Refer to [the documentation of the `HttpExchange` class](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/HttpExchange.html), which encapsulates an HTTP request and response as well.
* [Here's a quickstart guide](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3732328).

Your task is to create a custom annotation called `@WebRoute` which can be used to annotate methods.
Methods annotated with `@WebRoute("/path")` will be your HTTP request handlers.
They are called whenever a request accepted by the webserver matches the `"/path"` value in a `@WebRoute` annotation.

Use reflection to find the right method for an incoming request.

Here is an example:

```java
@WebRoute("/test")
String onTest() {
    // Here goes the code to handle all requests going to localhost:8000/test
    // and to return something
}
```

#### A little step-by-step guide

**Spolier alert! Only read this, if you struggle with the assignment!**

* create a simple **Maven project** in IntelliJ
* open this [quickstart guide](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3732328), and copy-paste the `Test` class
  * read through this response very carefully!
  * run your code
  * try to experiment with changing the `response` variable
  * maybe experiment with adding different path + handler combinations, like `server.createContext("/another", new AnotherMyHandler());`
  * don't forget to try all these paths in your web browser!
* add your `WebRoute.java` annotation to the project
* create a `Routes.java` class with two methods (`public String test1(){...} and public String test2(){...}`)
* annotate both of these methods with your `WebRoute` annotation with **different paths**, just like in the example above!
* now go back to your `Test` class, and try to process your `Routes` class, like this:

```java
for(Method m: Routes.class.getMethods()) {
  if(m.isAnnotationPresent(WebRoute.class)) {
    /*
      Here comes your logic.
      If the given path from the HttpExchange method is
      the SAME like the WebRoute annotation's path,
      you should INVOKE this method.
    */
  }
}
```

* you should decide about where you want to process these methods
  * the easy and cheap solution is, you process them right in the `MyHandler` class. This is not efficient, because it runs **every time** when a request arrives to the server! What a shame.
  * the good solution is, when you only **process the methods once at startup**, and store the path + method pairs in a `HashMap`! Try to figure it out, it's a way better solution.
* run your code in _Debug mode_ and inspect your `Method` instances to get a better insight

### Extra features

Support GET, POST, etc. as well. You will need to name the parameters in your annotation, for example:

```java
@WebRoute(method=POST, path = "/users")
String onTest() {
    // here goes the code to handle POST requests going to localhost:8000/users
}
 ```

Another feature is to extract variables from the path itself:

```java
@WebRoute("/user/<userName>")
String onTest(String userName) {
    // here goes the code to handle all requests going to localhost:8000/user/joe
}
```
